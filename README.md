# CheerUp


Checks you're emotions every 5 min and tries to cheer you up

## How it works

Every 5 minutes the app will take a photo using the webcam and use the [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api) to work out the dominationg emotion. If anger or sadness is detected then a random /r/aww page is opened to cheer the user up.
